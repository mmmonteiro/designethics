# Hello

Design needs a code of ethics. I've taken a stab at it. But together we can improve them. I only know what I know. And my point of view is limited to my own experiences. I'd also love to get these in other languages as well.

To add a language, create a file of the form languageCode.md (for a general translation) or languageCode_COUNTRYCODE.md for a regional dialect.

examples:
- General English: en.md
- UK English: en_UK.md

[List of Langauge Codes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)

[List of Country Codes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp)

And make sure to edit this README.md to add a link to your translation!

Looking forward to your pull requests.
