# Hello

Design needs a code of ethics. I've taken a stab at it. But together we can improve them. I only know what I know. And my point of view is limited to my own experiences. This text belongs to you now. Make it great.

I'd also love to get these in other languages as well.

To add a language, create a file of the form languageCode.md (for a general translation) or languageCode_COUNTRYCODE.md for a regional dialect.

examples:
- General English: `en.md`
- UK English: `en_UK.md`

[List of Language Codes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)

[List of Country Codes](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp)

And make sure to edit this README.md to add a link to your translation!

Looking forward to your pull requests.
